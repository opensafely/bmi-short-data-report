    "# Measuring BMI in OpenSAFELY-TPP\n",
    "This report describes how BMI can be identified in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, and the strengths and weaknesses of the methods. BMI has been identified as a risk factor for clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [1–3]. Electronic Health Records (EHR) hold significant potential for studying the association between BMI and COVID-19. This depends on the validity, completeness, and currency of BMI information that is available in or can be derived from EHR. Thus, this study aims to describe and compare methods for identifying BMI in EHR. This is a living document that will be updated to reflect changes to the OpenSAFELY-TPP database and the patient records within.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenSAFELY\n",
    "OpenSAFELY is an analytics platform for conducting analyses on Electronic Health Records inside the secure environment where the records are held. This has multiple benefits: \n",
    "\n",
    "* We don't transport large volumes of potentially disclosive pseudonymised patient data outside of the secure environments for analysis.\n",
    "* Analyses can run in near real-time as records are ready for analysis as soon as they appear in the secure environment.\n",
    "* All infrastructure and analysis code is stored in GitHub repositories, which are open for security review, scientific review, and re-use.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of OpenSAFELY is the use of study definitions, which are formal specifications of the datasets to be generated from the OpenSAFELY database. This takes care of much of the complex EHR data wrangling required to create a dataset in an analysis-ready format. It also creates a library of standardised and validated variable definitions that can be deployed consistently across multiple projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this report is to describe derivations of BMI, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and the scenarios in which they are best deployed. It will also describe potential future definitions that have not yet been implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Records\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSAFELY-TPP runs inside TPP’s data centre which contains the primary care records for all patients registered at practices using TPP’s SystmOne Clinical Information System. This data centre also imports external datasets from other sources, including A&E attendances and hospital admissions from NHS Digital’s Secondary Use Service, and death registrations from the ONS. More information on available data sources can be found within the [OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/data-sources/intro/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "We define four variable derivations: \"CTV3-calculated BMI\" (derived from CTV3 height and weight), \"SNOMED-calculated BMI\" (derived from SNOMED height and weight), \"SNOMED-recorded BMI\" (derived from directly recorded BMI values in SNOMED), and \"composite BMI\" (derived from CTV3-calculated BMI or SNOMED-recorded BMI, and implemented using most_recent_bmi function).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculated BMI refers to BMI calculated from height and weight measurements. Previous height records are carried over to the future to compute BMI with the assumption that there is little variation in an individual’s height in adulthood. New BMI records are only calculated when there is a new weight measurement, as there can be greater variation in weights. Height and weight measurements are derived using two sets of codelists, so we compare the derivations created using each of these codelists: \n",
    "  * CTV3-calculated BMI, which uses CTV3 height (\"XM01E\", \"229..\") and weight (\"X76C7\", \"22A..\") codes used in the OpenSAFELY-TPP backend.\n",
    "  * SNOMED-calculated BMI, which uses SNOMED [height](https://www.opencodelists.org/codelist/opensafely/height-snomed/3b4a3891/) and [weight](https://www.opencodelists.org/codelist/opensafely/weight-snomed/5459abc6/) codes.\n",
    "* SNOMED-recorded BMI refers to SNOMED-coded events of BMI. \n",
    "* Composite BMI refers to the canonical definition used in the OpenSAFELY backend using the [`most_recent_bmi()`](https://docs.opensafely.org/study-def-variables/#cohortextractor.patients.most_recent_bmi) function, which returns patients' most recent BMI (in the defined period) either calculated from CTV3-coded weight and height measurements or, where they are not available, from SNOMED-recorded BMI values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each registered patient aged 18 to 110 at the time of measurement, we extract up to ten latest BMI measurements (going back from 1st May 2022) for each method of derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate how well each of these derivations are populated, we count the number of patients with each type of BMI measurement, as well as the number of measurements themselves. We also examine the plausibility of each derivation by looking at the distribution of measurements and counting values out of the expected range. To evaluate how frequently the BMI derivations are recorded, we track the number of new measurements recorded over time and average time between updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examine trends across the whole population and by each of the following demographic and clinical subgroups to detect any inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic covariates:\n",
    "* Age band \n",
    "* Sex\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary constraints in creating the optimal BMI derivation: coverage, accuracy, and computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coverage:** While all four derivations are similar in the number of patients they cover, composite BMI captures the most number of measurements as it combines CTV3-calculated and SNOMED-recorded BMI definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy:** The two calculated BMI definitions contain more erroneous, implausible outliers that affect aggregated statistics such as means. While the recorded BMI derivation has 12 million fewer records than composite BMI, it contains fewer extreme outliers than the calculated BMI measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational complexity:** The `most_recent_bmi()` function (used to derive composite BMI) is resource-intensive to run as it executes complex SQL queries to use CTV3-calculated BMI in the first instance, and when CTV3-calculated BMI is missing, use recorded BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking these three constraints into account, there are two recommended solutions to create a consistent derivation of BMI in OpenSAFELY-TPP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use SNOMED-recorded BMI, dropping values that fall out of the expected range. This will offer reasonably good coverage, good accuracy with minimal cleaning, and reduce computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clean both the CTV3-calculated and SNOMED-recorded BMI definitions before they are combined to create composite BMI. This will require additional configuration in the backend, which may increase computational complexity, but this method will offer the maximum possible coverage of measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using either derivation of calculated BMI on its own does not offer the best coverage or accuracy. The results also show that the two calculated BMI definitions are negligibly different from each other; hence, the CTV3 and SNOMED height and weight codes can be used interchangeably to calculate BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not possible to extract event-level data in the current implementation of OpenSAFELY-TPP. As a result, coded events can only be extracted as single values in a time period. This study extracts 10 BMI values per patient based on a preliminary analysis that showed that, on average, each patient has 6 or 7 recorded BMI measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to server memory constraints, the covariates are constrained to extraction at a set index date (1st May 2022), rather than at the time of the event record. The covariates are adjusted to the time of measurement where possible (e.g. age is adjusted to the age at measurement date, based on the patient’s birthday). However, this is more difficult for factors that may change unpredictably over time (e.g. region or IMD) or for more transient clinical conditions (e.g. hypertension). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue posed by the memory constraints is the lack of cross-checks. Each derivation is analysed in separate scripts. Hence, there are no contingency tables (frequency tables showing correlations between definitions) or other analyses that describe overlap between the different derivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that patients who have not had a measurement show a value of 0 in the records. Because it is not possible to differentiate those who have not had a measurement from those whose measurement was recorded as 0, all 0-valued BMI records were excluded from the above analyses. As any true adult BMI should be greater than 0 (the minimum threshold we use for plausible values is 4), BMI values of 0 should be excluded from analyses regardless. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This report describes existing methods to derive BMI in OpenSAFELY-TPP and suggests improvements to the standard method. It is a living document that can be periodically re-run to evaluate the most current best practices for research. If you have improvements or forks, please contact the OpenSAFELY data team. \n",
